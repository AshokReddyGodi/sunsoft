                  <p>We are living in the information age and wireless communication networks provide the critical and vital infrastructure for anytime, anywhere connectivity to information. Advances in computing, communication and sensing technologies are enabling unprecedented new ways in which information can be gathered, processed and shared. Wireless technology is racing ahead and enabling a broad array of wireless networks, including cellular, mesh, ad hoc, and sensor networks, supporting an equally rich array of multimedia applications such as voice, data, images, and video. Wireless has spawned a communications revolution. And certainly, in a country as large as ours, any technology that brings us closer also makes us stronger.</p>
                <br>
                <p>S3 has made leading contributions to a wide range of problems in the development of basic theory and practical design strategies for wireless communication systems and sensor networks. The interdisciplinary research in our group draws on tools from a variety of areas, including communication theory, statistical signal processing, information theory, multipath channel modeling, physics of propagation, multiuser communication, machine learning, optimization, and time-frequency/harmonic analysis. </p>
                <br>
				<p>S3 offers re-usable IP cores which can be used as part of the large chain in the wireless transmitter and receiver products.</p>
				<br>
				<p>In research and teaching we intentionally motivate and maintain a working environment and attitude that strives for a rigorous understanding of the fundamentals of wireless communication while constantly challenging conventional wisdom so as to facilitate true invention. Throughout this process we maintain an understanding and an appreciation of the underlying physical principles and as such eventually verify our ideas in carefully designed experiments.</p>
