                  <p>cloud is redefining the operations, service delivery, and business models of dynamic organizations across industry verticals. However, the vastly different motivations and goals of each company make their path to cloud-enablement very unique. Cloud engineering services, customized to suit specific requirements and IT environment, take center-stage in this context.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We view cloud as a paradigm that enables organizations to operate more efficiently, while also further enables a service-based IT delivery model, resulting in improved responsiveness to business needs.</p>
                <br>
				<p>At S3, we leverage our deep understanding of the software product development landscape to offer tailored cloud-enablement services. We work with Independent Software Providers (ISVs) to co-create reliable, scalable, and cost effective cloud-ready products. We also work with customers across industries to make a smooth transition of their businesses onto the cloud.</p>
                <br>
				<p>As one the leading providers of IoT and connectivity solutions, an important aspect of cloud engineering from Our Firm is our ability to combine the power of virtualization, IoT and mobility with the cloud. The result is a range of intelligent cloud-enabled products with shorter time-to-market.</p>
